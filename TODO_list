This is a list of pending tasks!

TODO: 
1) ./src/sensor_observers/syscall_logger.cpp, ./include/sensor_observers/syscall_logger.h
2) ./src/sensor_observers/data_streams/output_stream.cpp, ./include/sensor_observers/data_streams/output_stream.h
3) ./src/sensor_observers/data_records/linux_syscall_record.cpp, ./include/sensor_observers/data_records/linux_syscall_record.h

4) ./test/driver --- This should just be a simple main that runs as a test.  Nothing formal.  Just see if it "blows up" or anything.

5) Get CMake integrated here and organize the compiled sources into the build directory.

LOW PRIORITY) Update ./doc/uml/heimdall.[dia|png]
